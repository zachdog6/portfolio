Side projects I worked on in my freetime. Each project has it's own README on how to run.

1. express and node: Small database manegemnt website. Uses a react frontend, express backend, and postgressSQL database.
2. sprint boot: Small chat application. Send messages to anyone who also has it open. uses JavaFx frontend and mySQL database.

For ease of use, each project uses small cloud databases hosted on elephandSQL/db4free. Should only be used for small scale testing only.
